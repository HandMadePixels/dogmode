<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that �a tired dog is a good dog�. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional �kennel� style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley�s leash law regulations.">

<span class="smalltext">Dog-day afternoons are a thing of the past for pampered pooches at DogMode </span><br>
<br>
Life's a lot more complicated than it used to be. These days, to get your little loved ones into the best institutions, 
        you have to fill out multipage applications, go through several grueling interviews, then cross your fingers and hope and 
        pray that the head of the establishment looks upon you and yours favorably. And that&rsquo;s just for day care&hellip; for dogs.<br>
        <br>
Welcome to DogMode in Murray, where &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a dog meet dog world,&rdquo; according to doggie day care owners and operators Jon and Susan Campbell. <br>
<br>
They run a posh paradise for pooches, where a fine time is had by all, especially the pet owners who come to pick their charges up at the end of the work day and find them pampered, petted and best of all, pooped. <br>
<br>
The dogs are delighted. They get to spend the day running around with their friends, sunning themselves, playing in the sandbox or splashing in the pool. <br>
<br>
When they&rsquo;ve had enough outdoor recreation, they can retreat into an air conditioned play room, jump on a purple-sheeted four-poster bed, watch TV, chase balls, 
        or climb all over boxes and ramps constructed especially for their, amusement. It&rsquo;s a veritable doggie Disneyland. <br>
        <br>
The dogs are well-supervised and cared for at all times, and if they&rsquo;re bad or don&rsquo;t play well with others (behavior that is usually avoided due to the intense screening process), 
        they are given time out, and made to sit alone in their &ldquo;suites&rdquo; until they calm down. Some people might call these fenced cubicles kennels, but they don&rsquo;t use the &ldquo;k&rdquo; word at DogMode.<br>
        <br>
With so much group play time, you can see why dogs and owners must submit themselves to such an excruciating screening process. 
        First owners must fill out a six-page &ldquo;enrollment&rdquo; form, then the dog must be &ldquo;interviewed&rdquo; by one of the Campbells, then, last but not least, 
        the dog is taken into the &ldquo;Sniffing Room&rdquo; where everyone watches how it interacts with several doggy peers. 
        The Campbells are very good-natured about the process, and owners understand that if their pets don&rsquo;t pass it&rsquo;s for their own good that they stay at home alone in their own comfortable territory. <br>
        <br>
&ldquo;We started a business that would provide several services for our dogs that we couldn&rsquo;t find all in one place,&rdquo; says Jon Campbell. 
        The staff at DogMode, located at 4030 South 210 West, will care for your dog and have it amused for the day, accommodate your dog overnight, and 
        provide facilities where you can shampoo your dog in one of three specially constructed doggie bath stalls, then have it blown dry in a unique doggie dryer. <br>
        <br>
&ldquo;Some dogs like the dryer, some don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says Susan Campbell. &ldquo;Almost all dogs like a bath, and, as you know, they love to shake the water everywhere. 
        When you wash your dog here, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about messing up your bathroom. &ldquo;The Campbells&rdquo; will wash your dog for you, for an extra charge. <br>
        <br>
Surprisingly enough, all these services are quite reasonable when you compare them with human prices. 
        A wash is only $10.00 and DogMode supplies all the equipment, including towels, shampoo and conditioner. 
        Nighttime accommodations are $30 a night. Day care rates start at $20 for one day, and decreasing to $80 for seven days. <br>
        <br>
The Campbells both have business and computer backgrounds and know how to run a tight ship, but it&rsquo;s impossible to take your business too 
        seriously when at any given moment the dogs are performing their own three-ring circus. The Campbells know all their charges by name, 
        and they know where they like to be scratched. This is not an easy task when the numbers can come close to 30 at a time. 
        They&rsquo;ll be expanding their facilities soon, because they&rsquo;re almost full to capacity now.<br>
        <br>
Meanwhile, the phrase, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a dog&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; takes on a whole new definition at DogMode. 
        Neighbors in the industrial area close to the Humane Society come by just to watch the dogs have fun, 
        and more than one has tried to check in. The Campbells have to be selective about their clientele, however, and limit it to canines only.<br>
