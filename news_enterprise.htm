<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that “a tired dog is a good dog”. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

<br>
DogMode, a nine-year-old Murray business that offers canine boarding and &ldquo;doggie day care,&rdquo; has greatly expanded the size and scope of its operations.<br>
<br>
Formerly located in approximately 6,000 square feet at 4010 S. 210 W., the firm moved about 10 days ago into a 15,000 square foot facility on one acre at 4030 S. 210 W. that also includes an indoor/outdoor area for its resident pooches.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;Our other facility was very good and we had a great following and we grew, but this new facility is bigger and better. 
    We&rsquo;ve purchased state-of-the-art materials like drain systems and flush lines,&rdquo; said owner Jon Campbell. 
    &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the first facility of our kind in the state and have won Best of State awards in 2003 and 2004 and a City Weekly Best of Utah award in 2001.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
Campbell said the new DogMode facility features 100 kennels &mdash; with elevated therapeutic beds &mdash; in addition to a large indoor/outdoor 
    play area where dogs are able to choose between being outside surrounded by a cinderblock wall (to prevent digging or jumping) or 
    being inside in a temperature-controlled environment. DogMode is open 365 days a year and its staff, which is currently being increased, 
    continuously monitors the facility&rsquo;s canine denizens, &ldquo;giving them plenty of love and attention,&rdquo; Campbell said.<br>
    <br>
At night, the facility is unmanned, but Campbell said the structure is highly safe and secure, equipped with carbon monoxide and smoke detectors, burglar alarms and motion sensors.<br>
<br>
Campbell said he is in the process of setting up &ldquo;doggie Web cams&rdquo; so pet owners will be able to keep an eye on their pooches via a new DogMode Web site that is nearing completion.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a much safer and more secure environment than just leaving your dogs at home during the day while you go to work,&rdquo; he said. <br>
<br>
All dogs that patronize DogMode are subject to three requirements &mdash; that they are fully vaccinated, that they are spayed or neutered if older than seven months and that they get along well with other canines.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;We have a separate room that&rsquo;s solely for the purpose of screening. We call it the &lsquo;sniffing room,&rsquo;&rdquo; Campbell said. 
    &ldquo;We conduct what we call a doggie interview. We take them in the room without the owner to see how they behave. 
    We take them off leash, then bring in a male dog, a female dog, an old dog, a young dog, a big dog, a little dog, a rowdy dog and a mellow dog just to see what their behavior is. 
    If that goes all right, we schedule a day of day care for you, free.&rdquo;<br>
    <br>
DogMode also offers dog-bathing services. Clients can either bathe their dogs themselves or have DogMode staff do so.<br>
<br>
Despite having a much larger and better facility, Campbell said his prices have remained largely unchanged. 
    Day care pricing remains the same, at $20 for the first day and $15 for each additional day of the same week. 
    Boarding prices have been slightly adjusted. While a sliding scale based on the number of overnight stays was formerly employed, 
    Campbell said he opted to eliminate any possible confusion on the part of customers and charge a flat $30 per day.<br>
    <br>
In November 2004, DogMode published a book titled Dog Friendly Parks and Trails in the Wasatch. 
    Fifty percent of the profits from the book&rsquo;s sale are donated to Intermountain Therapy Animals. 
    DogMode is also supports the No More Homeless Pets program by serving as a foster home at no charge for the dogs of Wasatch Humane, Humane Society of Utah, Best Friends, Friends of Utah Bassets and others. <br>
    <br>
DogMode will host a &ldquo;pet adoptathon&rdquo; in conjunction with Humane Society of Utah April 1-2.<br><br><br></td>
