<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that “a tired dog is a good dog”. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

        <span class="subtitle">Canine Respiratory Coronavirus</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="smalltitle">September 2008</span><BR>
Wherever dogs congregate it is possible for illnesses to be transmitted from one dog to another. 
    Respiratory viruses are especially easily transmitted. 
    People commonly associate kennel cough with respiratory viruses but there are many others.<br>
    <br>
Recently, a second type of Canine Coronavirus (Group II) has been shown to cause respiratory disease in dogs. 
    This virus is known as Canine Respiratory Coronavirus (CRCoV) and found to be similar to strain OC43 of bovine and human Coronaviruses. 
    It is usually self limiting in 3 &ndash; 5 days.<br>
    <br>
Currently there is not a vaccine for this and the common Bordetella vaccine does not protect against it. 
    Symptoms are basically the same for Canine Respiratory Coronavirus as they are for the more commonly known kennel cough.<br>
    <br>
Salt Lake Veterinary Services has sent titers to Pfizer for testing of every dog that we have had them examine for coughing over the past few months. 
    This is to identify what agent is involved and to help in the development of an effective vaccine. 
    Every sample has come back as Canine Respiratory Coronavirus. <br>
    <br>
When treated with antibiotics in a timely fashion, most dogs recover with no complications. 
    However, in a few cases, dogs became very ill and required hospitalization.
    While none of the dogs examined by Salt Lake Veterinary Services died from these upper respiratory infections, we have heard of at least one dog that died at another veterinary hospital from complications that arose.<br>
    <br>
One thing we have noticed with Canine Respiratory Coronavirus is that it seems to be even more inviting to some of the more serious bacterial infections than the more common kennel cough. 
    We have noticed that if symptoms are to get worse, they can do so very rapidly. 
    For example, a dog may be doing fine one evening and then wake up the next morning with complications. <br>
    <br>
Even though it is possible for dogs to recover with no medication, we recommend a strong dose of antibiotics if Canine Respiratory Coronavirus is suspected 
    because we have seen a small number of cases become complicated with secondary bacterial infections.<br>
    <br>
As always, in order to ensure the cleanest facility possible, our indoor areas are cleaned twice daily by a floor cleaning machine that applies 79 pounds of scrubbing pressure. 
    This machine applies disinfectant, sucks it back up and then squeegees the floor dry. 
    This process leaves the floor cleaner and dryer for all the dogs to enjoy. 
    We also sanitize our outdoor area and play lands daily.<br>
    <br>
Each morning, personal bedding is collected and washed in our commercial size machines if needed. 
    Every sleeping quarter in the building is then sprayed down and sanitized to prepare for the next night's stay. <br>
    <br>
All feeding trays and watering bowls are cleaned after each meal.<br><br><br></td>
