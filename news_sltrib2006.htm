<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that “a tired dog is a good dog”. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

Dogs run free in the open space at Dogmode as owner Jon Campbell mingles with the canines and gets a kiss from a happy client. The facility has service available on a day-by-day basis, as well as kennels for long-term stays. Dogs run free in the open space at Dogmode as owner Jon Campbell mingles with the canines. Wowsers - that's a lot of bowsers!<br>
<br>
Big ones, little ones, curly ones, straight ones - scores of four-legged friends woof it up every day in the large play area at Dogmode.<br>
<br>
"Bye sweetie, you have fun today," Tawni Hanseen tells Sadie, her 3-year-old Labrador, as she drops her off for day care in the building tucked amid warehouses at 4030 S. 210 West, about half a block north of the Murray city limits. It occupies a 15,000 square-foot building that once housed a sprinkler-supply business.<br>
<br>
"I bring her here once a week," explains Hanseen. "She likes it."<br>
<br>
About the same time, the Riddle family dropped off Ozzy - an 18-month-old Labrador. Ozzy came for boarding while the family left town for a few days.<br>
<br>
"I have no uneasiness about leaving him here," says Shana Richie.<br>
<br>
"It's good for the dogs that need to play with other dogs. [Here,] they're not kept in their kennels all day," added 11-year-old Lexy Riddle.<br>
<br>
Dogmode owner Jon Campbell came up with the concept eight years ago after having a bad boarding experience with one of his own dogs.<br>
<br>
"I used the back-of-a-napkin approach, made up a business plan, applied for a small-business loan and got approval," says Campbell.<br>
<br>
In 1999, Dogmode was the first doggy day care and nontraditional boarding environment to open in the Salt Lake Valley. Since then, spinoff businesses have sprouted.<br>
<br>
"Seven years later, I'm not a rich man, but I'm happy I did it," says Campbell. On a scale of 1 to 10, he says his job satisfaction tops out.<br>
<br>
Evidently, it pays to do what you love. In 2001, Campbell's pioneer enterprise got two paws up as City Weekly's "Best of Utah." It also garnered Best of State awards in 2003 and 2004.<br>
<br>
In March, Campbell moved his thriving business from its original location at 4010 S. 210 West, to its larger site just down the block.<br>
<br>
Just inside Dogmode's lobby are elevated, tiled showers where owners can bathe their pups themselves for $10, or have Campbell's staff do the deed for a few more dollars.<br>
<br>
Wearing a telephone headset, Dogmode's operations manager, Julie Yunk, assists customers as they drop off their canine family members.<br>
<br>
Dogmode's computers are conveniently networked, and information about each canine client is entered into a database. Campbell has a new Web site in the works and plans to install "webcams" so people can watch their pups play from other locations.<br>
<br>
Its clean environment hits capacity at 100 dogs. Usually, about half come for day-care; the other half are longer-term boarders.<br>
<br>
"The kennels cost more than I paid for my house," grins Campbell. Each dog cubicle has a slightly sloped floor, flushable drain system and solid walls in between - to prevent fence-fighting, explains Campbell.<br>
<br>
A stainless-steel water pail clips inside the kennel door to avoid spills, and therapeutic dog-cots occupy each "cubbie." If they would like, owners can toss in blankets or other items that smell like home.<br>
<br>
Dogs occupy their kennels from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. - but roam free during the day in the sizable, secure playroom, which has a garage door that opens to a fenced area outside.<br>
<br>
Owners supply their own dog chow, which staff members prepare and deliver to the dogs in their runs - to avoid food fights. After eating, they get 30 to 40 minutes of rest to avoid a phenomenon called "bloat," says Campbell.<br>
<br>
Sean Gautschy and L.J. Andrus, Dogmode's manager and assistant manager, interact with the dogs as they play, occasionally squirting them with water from handheld spray bottles, a practice that has a calming effect.<br>
<br>
On the job for six years, Gautschy knows each dog by name - like a schoolteacher, he says.<br>
<br>
"If there is a downside to working here, it's not being able to take the job home with you," says Andrus, who has been with Dogmode since 2001.<br>
<br>
All told, Campbell employs about 15 to staff this hub of hound activity seven days a week, 365 days a year.<br>
<br>
Oz, a giant schnauzer, recently turned 7, and has come to Dogmode three to four days a week since puppyhood.<br>
<br>
"He needs socializing and exercise," says Rebecca Trayner, Oz's owner. "This is the best place in the world. I would never go anywhere else."<br>
<br>
"He's one of the family," says Campbell, greeting the huge Oz with a hug. <br>
