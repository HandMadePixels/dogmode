<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that “a tired dog is a good dog”. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

June 17, 1999<br>
<br>
A good body-slam and tangle, followed by a nap on the queen-sized bed in their office, is all part of a days work for the principals of a new Salt Lake company. 
    President Margie and vice president Lilah never miss an opportunity to get their clients into a wrestling match. 
    And they don&rsquo;t have much trouble drawing out their human co-proprietors, Sue and Jon Campbell.<br>
    <br>
The latter pair first thought of starting DogMode, an alternative dog day care and boarding kennel, for the benefit of their own pets. 
    Margie, a 2-year-old who looks like a cross between a boxer and a Labrador retriever, had been traumatized by a traditional kennel experience, Jon Campbell said. 
    He returned from a business trip to find she had lost weight and was still losing her hair and her joie de vivre. &ldquo;It took her weeks to recover,&rdquo; he said. <br>
    <br>
The Salt Lake City couple began thinking about a place that had more yard than cage. 
    This place could have room to run, structures to jump on, a kiddie pool, a sandbox &ndash; and plenty of playmates. <br>
    <br>
DogMode, 4030 South 210 West, has all that. 
    The Campbells opened their gates May 15 and have been romping with, washing and drying guests ever since. 
    Margie is obviously quite pleased with her company, as is Lilah, the Dalmatian cross who is her second in command. 
    The two Campbell dogs share their days with Saint Bernards, Jack Russell Terriers, Golden Retrievers and any other dog that needs a place while owners are away at work.<br>
    <br>
&ldquo;We interview the owners to make sure their dogs are socialized,&rdquo; said Jon Campbell. 
    &ldquo;We meet the dog ahead of time, and we can pretty much tell if it can get along in a group setting.&rdquo; <br>
    <br>
Guests must have had all of their vaccinations and, if over 7 months old, they must be spayed or neutered. 
    The dogs have 4,000 square feet of fenced yard outdoors and 2,000 square feet indoors, while the Campbells keep track of meals, medications and special needs on a large marker board in the sniffing room. <br>
    <br>
&ldquo;We have a do-it-yourself grooming area,&rdquo; said Campbell, adding that he once tackled grooming a Saint Bernard. 
    Five hours later, he decided to let guest dog owners have the room and the tools. Campbell also built four white-tile tubs for self-serve dog bathing. 
    &ldquo;And we have three water heaters. We never wanted to run out of hot water,&rdquo; said Sue Campbell. 
    Owners can gave their pets lie down in the drying booth, a clear, ventilated version of the beauty-salon hair dryer. 
    When a guest arrives at DogMode, &ldquo;everybody wants to say hi, but that can freak the new dog out,&rdquo; said Jon Campbell. 
    &ldquo;So we just introduce them to a couple of dogs at a time.&rdquo; A few sniffs later, friendships have formed and the games are on. 
    Margie and Lilah play hard, but if guest don&rsquo;t want to body slam, they can go to another part of the yard. 
    Some just like to recline in the kiddie pool and then lie down in the sand. All enjoy a lot of petting and holding from the Campbells and their staff. <br>
    <br>
The only time the dogs go into kennels is when they eat, sleep or &ldquo;if they need a time out,&rdquo; said Jon Campbell. 
    "Sometimes their play escalates, and they need a minute to calm down. &ldquo; They all respond well to affection. 
    Exercise and socializing do wonders for a dog&rsquo;s attitude, the Campbells said. If a pet is alone and confined for hours, its frustration may turn it into a chewer, a barker, a digger or an escape artist. <br>
    <br>
Guilt relief for owners and unfettered play for dogs costs $20 for the first day, $35 for two days, $50 for three and so on. A do-it-yourself wash is $10. Boarding is $30 a night.<br><br><br></td>
