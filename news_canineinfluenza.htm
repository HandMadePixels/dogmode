<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that “a tired dog is a good dog”. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

        <span class="subtitle">Canine Influenza</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="smalltitle">October 2009</span><BR>
DogMode Team Leaders, along with a   Salt Lake Vet Services Technician, attended a seminar on the Canine Influenza on   October 15, 2009. This seminar was hosted by Kimberly Wilmert with   Intervet/Schering-Plough Animal Health and Central Valley Veterinary   Clinic.<BR>
<BR>
The topic of the seminar was the origin and spread of the disease   among our canine friends, diagnosing and treating, and the H3N8 Flu Vaccine. The   attendees will be providing the updated information to the entire DogMode Team   over the next week. As of October 16, 2009, Clients can request educational   material on this topic at the DogMode front counter. <BR>
<BR>
After receiving   this information, DogMode simply recommends that you take the time to discuss   Canine Influenza with your Vet and educate yourself on the illness and vaccine.   We will continue to acquire information from a handful of Vets in our community   to determine whether or not we should require this vaccine as a business. <BR>
<BR>
Please note that the Canine Flu can not be contracted from canines to   humans. As always, thank you for being caring and responsible dog   guardians.<BR>
<BR>
Bark on! <BR>

<span class="smalltitle">November   2006</span><BR>
Everyone should be aware of this relatively new   virus.<BR>
<BR>
This virus started in the Greyhound Race tracks and has gradually   been moving all around the country. It has been confirmed that this virus is now   in Utah as well as many other states.<BR>
<BR>
Dogs do not have natural immunity   for it and there is no vaccine available at this time.<BR>
<BR>
The symptoms are   very similar to those of Kennel Cough, which causes the frequent misdiagnosis of   Canine Influenza. Dog owners should watch their dogs closely for signs such as:   coughing, increased respiration, gagging and high   temperature.<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, if treatment is started as soon as symptoms are   noticed, most dogs recover with no problems. As with any kind of virus, dogs who   are diabetic, very old, very young, or undergoing chemotherapy are more at risk,   as are dogs with other diseases such as Addison&rsquo;s disease. Treatment includes   prescribing antibiotics to prevent any secondary bacterial infections that can   be dangerous. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to DogMode&rsquo;s standard cleaning and   disinfecting procedure which is performed TWICE daily with an automated floor   scrubber that applies 79 pounds of scrubbing pressure while applying clean   disinfectant the entire time - plus the effective scrubbing and hosing of   disinfectant in all of DogMode&rsquo;s drain-system kennels daily; some systems   DogMode has in place to further eliminate / contain the spread of illness   include the creation of 3 separate zones for dogs.<BR>
<BR>
<img src="img/paragraph-line.jpg" alt="line" width="464" height="2"><br>
<br>
<br>
<span class="smalltitle">An example of how DogMode can utilize the different zones is as   follows:</span><BR>
<BR>
<span class="subtitle">Zone 1:</span> A fully contained   daycare area with solid walls and separate ventilation system for dogs that we   are 90% sure are healthy. The dogs are not showing signs or symptoms and have   not been showing signs or symptoms for at least 5 days.<BR>
<BR>
<span class="subtitle">Zone 2:</span> A fully contained daycare area with solid walls   and separate ventilation system for dogs that are not showing symptoms but due   to the 1 - 5 day incubation period, we are not positive they have not been   infected somewhere, Dog Park, Vet Office, anywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<span class="subtitle">Zone 3:</span> A fully contained isolation area with solid walls   and separate ventilation system for dogs that are showing signs and symptoms. <BR>
<BR>
<span class="smalltitle">DogMode has also set up a decontamination process   for employees when leaving the Zone where the dogs showing signs and symptoms   are located. They have clothing they wear over their standard clothing which   they remove in the decontamination zone where they disinfect shoes, hands, face,   etc before entering the clean or safe zone.</span><BR>
<BR>
The Department of   Agriculture and Food agrees that the systems DogMode has in place are the   correct way to be handling this kind of situation. This kind of system to   contain and reduce as much transmission from dog to dog as possible is paramount   in getting and keeping this under control. All Boarding Facilities, Daycare   Facilities, Grooming Facilities, and Vet offices should be taking steps like   this.<br><br><br></td>
