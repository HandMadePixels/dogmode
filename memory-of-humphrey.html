<title>DogMode | In Memory of Humphrey</title>
<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that “a tired dog is a good dog”. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

				<span class="memorial"><div align="justify""><p>Humphrey came into my life when he was 2 years old.  I adopted him from a Super Adoption.  He was in the last cage on the last row and when I walked by him, he looked at me and said he was mine.  When I got him home, I found out that my 70 pound, full grown basset hound had no leash skills or any obedience training and had been abused.  He was scared of everyone, except his family.  He seem to understand he was family now and would be taken care of for the rest of his life.<br><br>
 
Slowly, but surely, he left the majority of his bad habits and fear behind and then it happened.  I had to go out of town, and while my mom could take care of him during the night, during the day, he needed a bit of supervision during the day.....<br><br>
 
And that's when DogMode entered into the picture, I was SOOO nervous for his interview, but he passed and made it into the DogMode family, and that's when he truly healed.  He was accepted into the pack and learned to play with other dogs and found out pretty quick that everyone who works at DogMode has a PhD in bellyrubs.   <br><br>
 
Humphrey's first exposure to DogMode was going everyday (Monday-Friday) for 2 weeks.  I'm told he did not move on the weekends, but was always ready to go back.<br><br>
 
After I got home, he started a once a week schedule that he maintained until his passing, with extended Summer Camps (as we call boarding visits) thrown in too...  And when Bacall entered the picture, he showed her the ropes.<br><br>
 
There are no words to express the feeling of relief and thanks when you have a place to take your dog when you are out of town or they just need to burn off some extra energy (yes, Bassets have some) off.<br><br>
 
Humphrey loved DogMode and all of the staff, even when he would yell at them.....<br><br>
 
Woof....</p></span>
