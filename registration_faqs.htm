<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that “a tired dog is a good dog”. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

    	<br>
        <span class="subtitle">If all the dogs are off leash together at DogMode during the day, do they get along well? </span><br>
All dogs that come to DogMode for Daycare or Boarding must first go through an initial prescreening, which we like to call a &ldquo;doggie interview&rdquo;. 
      While we don&rsquo;t ask the dogs too many tough questions, we do make sure that they&rsquo;re not aggressive by nature, and that they get along well with others. 
      As an additional measure against potential doggie discord, there are always multiple DogMode staff members giving supervision and love to the dogs during daycare hours. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="subtitle">Where does my dog sleep at night?</span><br>
DogMode offers state-of-the-art dog runs to be used as sleeping quarters at night. 
      The extra roomy runs all have solid walls, sloped floors, and a patented drain system that flushes with water resulting in the most safe, comfortable and sanitary environment possible.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="subtitle">Is the Daycare/Boarding environment heated and air conditioned?</span><br>
Of course! DogMode&rsquo;s entire facility has always been heated and air conditioned to offer the most comfortable environment possible for all of our guests. <br>
<br>
<span class="subtitle">Can my dog move around from the outside to the inside area of DogMode at will? </span><br>
Yes! Our outdoor yards are available all day long for all of our canine guests to utilize for nurture or nature as they so choose. 
      There&rsquo;s plenty of room for all the dogs to travel in and out of our spaces freely. 
      Our outdoor areas are not only sanitary but are extra secure with solid concrete walls that go deep into the ground and are over 6 feet high. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="subtitle">What if my dog requires special medication during daytime or overnight stays? </span><br>
DogMode takes great care of all guests, and we always administer any necessary medications completely free of charge. 
      However, dog owners are required to sign a medical form in advance.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="subtitle">Can we bring our pet&rsquo;s food for overnight stays? </span><br>
Yes, please do! It is important to keep your dog on his or her diet while boarding. 
      It can be stressful for your dog to be away from you and introducing a new food can upset stomachs. <br>
      <br>
      <span class="subtitle">Can I bring my dog's own bed? </span><br>
DogMode provides awesome elevated beds that are designed to keep your dog comfortable and dry during the night. 
<!--      It is best to bring a small blanket that we can put on top of our beds to give them some extra cozy comfort and smells from home. -->
      <br>
      <br>
      <span class="subtitle">Can I drop my dog off for daycare or pick it up from overnight boarding on a Sunday?</span><br>
Yes! DogMode is open 7 days per week, 365 days per year, 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.<br><br><br></td>
