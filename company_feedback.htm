Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

Thank you so much for taking care of and easing our dogs stay away from us. As you know it was a difficult time for all of us for quite some time but we are very pleased how they've adjusted. We certainly will bring them back. In fact whenever we are out of town, it is with you guys where we will always bring them. You have all been fantastic. But it will be nice to be together as a family once again. We have never been separated for more than a few weeks until now. It's been hard. We would like to know exactly their feeding schedule and after they've eaten, how long is it until they need to go potty. We want to keep them on the same schedule. As well as what times does Strider get his medication? Last but not least we would like to know how well the dogs like the cots you have and if they use them we would like to purchase two. If they don't then we don't want to waste money. <br><br>
 
Alisha, thank you. Your are greatly appreciated as well as the entire staff.<br>
Thank you<br>

We wanted to thank you for everything you have done for Magic (and us) over the years. Your willingness to give her breaks and keep a close eye on her was appreciated and we always felt she was in good hands with you. Your warmth and positive attitude have made our experience with DogMode wonderful. We miss Magic like crazy, but we'll certainly keep bringing Harper in and hopefully we will have a new pup in the fall. :) <br><br>
 
Warm Regards, <br>

Susan Butler<br><br>

Subject:  thank you (why dogmode is great)<br><br>


Susan,<br><br>

A quick note to say thanks for continuing to have such a great place to bring my dogs. Back in the day, it was Meg; then, Meg and Luna; now, just Luna. Why I have continued to come to DogMode - coming back to board my dogs when I needed to travel overseas by driving back from upstate New York - is that I can be certain that they will have a great and safe place to be.<br><br>
 
I just had yet another great experience @ DogMode - new faces to me, Emily and Brittany - and I just wanted to let you know that your continued commitment to ensuring that the "front of the house" experience is top notch is noticed and matters. What I have always found puzzling across dog-related services is that everything other than the care itself is often a logistical mess: for example, scheduling an appointment at the vet, a call-back where a tech has not read the material, erratic opening hours. While all of that can be overcome, it is not particularly confidence inspiring. This can be generalized to all other service businesses as well, and experiences that are not consistent and do not occur as messy leave customers feeling good about their experience. In cases that are less than messy one is left with the nagging question: if they can't remember what I was coming in for, how can I have any confidence that my car/dog/et cetera got the care I wanted for them?<br><br>
 
DogMode is an exceptional case because you've been able to maintain that level of quality and consistency for over a decade, irrespective of who is up front. It is clearly a part of the culture. This is something that was built into the DNA of DogMode from the beginning, and I just wanted to briefly send you a note and acknowledge what you have created and honor you for it - not just because it is great for Luna and myself, but because, in the world of business, you have created a truly remarkable thing.<br><br>


Warm Regards, <br>

Brent Butler and Pam Butler/Staff at DogMode<br><br>

RE: Care and Love of Tazz Kaizumi while Vicki and Kraig Kaizumi were in Africa.<br><br>


Dear Brent and Pam,<br><br>

	Appreciation for your vigilance over Tazz. When I said good-by through the window his eyes were as big as saucers and he looked scared. I felt so bad but at that point I had few choices but to leave him in professional care and trust that he was in the hands of people that cared. My judgment was not wrong.<br><br>

	Being taken into the Butler home and the love and stimulation that he received got him through his feeling of abandonment, fear, and depression.  We thank you for that.  It made all the difference in the world.  Brent it was so clear how attached he was to you that I didn't know if Tazz wanted to came home!  It makes me so happy that you took him into your home and hearts during those many days.<br><br>

	His regular caregiver when we travel was diagnosed with cancer and is doing poorly.  She is trying to sell her business and her situation had become very unstable on a lot of different levels.  We needed to find another situation for what turned out to be one of the longest times we have left Tazz.<br><br>

	We came right in to DogMode after a flight of over 25 hours. We were tired and we hope you understand my lack of manners in not introducing you to Kraig, my husband.  We have been Zombies trying to get used to our regular time zone. South Africa is 8 hours ahead of us here in S.L.C.  Kraig and I are still waking up bright eyes and bushy tailed at 1:00 AM. ready to go on a game drive.<br><br>

	We saw the pictures and e-mails that you sent when we got home.  Mackenzie giving him a bath and Pam grooming him was not the extra special care we had expected.   I thought about Tazz but for some unconscious reason did not over worry about him, when you are on another continent over 25,000+ miles away you have to trust and hope that he does okay and I knew he was in good hands.<br><br>

	I was fully expecting him to come out scruffy and long. I had given him a bath before he come in but had prepared myself for the many hours it would take to get him back into shape.  Here he comes out all spiffy and in a cute red hoodie looking like Mr. Cool and all happy to boot. We got more than our monies worth and we thank you from the bottoms of our hearts.<br><br>


Thank you, <br>
<span class="subtitle">Viki and Kraig</span><br>

I just wanted to take a minute to compliment you on how wonderful your business is. I recently brought my German Shepherd, Max, to be boarded in your facility. I have been to many dog daycare/boarding places and absolutely none of them compare to yours. I was impressed by the entire questionnaire/interview process and grateful that I could feel at ease leaving my dog in your care. Not only is the facility in beautiful condition but the staff is top-notch. In a day and age where customer service is virtually non-existent, the DogMode staff simply blows everyone else away! I cannot say enough wonderful things about my entire experience there. Not to mention that Max came home tired and happy!<br><br>
 
I am sure you receive many e-mails like this but I still wanted to acknowledge a job well done. Thank you so much for everything and I wish your business continued success. I will spread the work to whomever I can about DodMode :)<br><br>
 
Sincerely, <br>

To the DogMode crew.<br>
<br>
I wanted to thank you for all that you did to help me and Louie the CAWS dog. Because of your efforts and help, he has a forever home. This would not have been possible without your help. You helped him to learn how to be a socialized dog and the staff helped him with his comfort level with people too. You helped me by making him tired enough that I could work on his other hang-ups and help him to be a great dog. I can't thank you enough.<br><br>
Teryn, I wanted to thank you for caring about the feelings of a heart broken foster mom. It gave me strength to hear your words and the hug helped to soothe my soul. I am looking forward to my next foster and hope to bring her to DogMode too. Thanks!<br><br>

Hi Everyone-<br><br>Oct. 15, 2012<br><br>
On Oct 12, 2012 our Cody suffered conjestive heart failure, probably due to an undetected heart tumor. She was doing what she loved, playing ball. With very saddened hearts, we had to say goodbye four days later. She was a very sick little girl. She was 12.5 years old.<br><br> 
We want all of you to know how much she loved you even though it took her awhile to show it to some. We wanted to tell you thanks, so very much for your loving care. Cody was a frequent tenant for more than 12 years. She would get so excited when she knew she was coming to DogMode. <br><br>
With love and thanks, <br>
<br>
<span class="subtitle">Cody and her parents, Fred and Sharon.  (Cody: April 9,2000 to October 7,2012)</span><br>

			Thank you so much for taking such great care of our Dog Kami. 
        	I was very nervous about boarding but after meeting your friendly and efficient staff I knew she was in good hands. 
        	I will be looking forward to using your services in the future!<br><br>

			Emmitt was having issues this morning. 
        	His blood sugar level was a little lower than target range (120) and he was being very stubborn. 
        	I gave him a snack and had to carry him into DogMode because he only wanted to get back in the car. 
        	I let Julie know and asked her to give him a treat at 10:00 if it wasn&rsquo;t above 150.
        	At 10 he was 87, so she gave him a bone and called me. After another test (a little lower), another bone, and a little Caro syrup they got his blood sugar going in the other direction.<br><br>

			Your staff takes such good care of Emmitt and keeps a close eye on him. 
        	Because they know him so well and are well trained in monitoring his blood sugar, I actually feel more secure about having Emmitt at DogMode than at the vet hospital. 
        	Julie asked if she should take him to Central Valley, but because it wasn&rsquo;t yet an emergency situation (just a concerning situation), I felt that he was in better care there.<br><br>

			I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate you and your staff. 
        	With the schedule he is on for feeding and glucose testing, I certainly couldn&rsquo;t do it without you all. 
        	Now, as well as prior to his diabetic diagnosis, the services you provide have been invaluable to both of us. 
        	Would you please share with everyone how much they mean to me and, I&rsquo;m sure, the other dog Mom&rsquo;s and Dad&rsquo;s. <br><br>

			Thanks so much for your assistance,<br><br>

			The Wonderful Staff of DogMode:<br><br>
			I can&rsquo;t even begin to express my thanks to all of you in regards to Nick. 
        	It may seem like you were just doing your job; but your knowledge and attention and quick actions quite possibly saved Nicks life. <br><br>
            
			I always knew you guys were great, but now I really know you&rsquo;re all amazing!<br><br>
			Nick is doing much better! He&rsquo;s almost back to his normal, bouncy, go lucky, goof ball self. 
        	Unfortunately he can&rsquo;t come play for a while; until he&rsquo;s all healed. 
        	He has a total of 32 staples in his belly but you wouldn&rsquo;t know it by the way he&rsquo;s being so happy!<br><br>

			As soon as he&rsquo;s ready, he&rsquo;ll be back to play! Thank you all for your great care & love for all the dogs that come to spend their day there.<br><br>

			Love,<br><br>

			Thanks for taking such good care of Eddy. 
        	He had a great time and can&rsquo;t wait to come back. 
        	It&rsquo;s so nice to be on a trip and know that he is not only doing well, but is really playing his heart out.<br><br>

			Many Thanks &ndash;<br><br>

			Dear DogMode:<br><br>

			Let&rsquo;s face it; going back with all the other dogs at DogMode is obviously nor Charlie&rsquo;s favorite past time. 
        	I know he spends a lot of time sitting in the corner. 
        	So I am mildly surprised that every time I bring him to DogMode he eagerly jumps out of the car, pees on your wall, and then trots inside with little or no encouragement. 
        	He also does not like slick floors, but he still comes right into the office on the shiny floor.<br><br>

			What Charlie loves at DogMode is your wonderful staff. 
        	You have chosen real &ldquo;Dog People&rdquo; who have a knack for making even the shy dogs feel at home. 
        	I know Charlie spends a lot of time up at the desk with special friends; a visitor saw Charlie come out of the back one day and said, &ldquo;Oh there&rsquo;s the desk dog.&rdquo; 
        	And I know he has special friends who work in the back; they don&rsquo;t always know me, but they always know Charlie.<br><br>

			Thank you for taking the time and trouble to hire people who are so good with dogs. 
        	It makes a difference for a little dog that really prefers people to dogs. 
        	I think Charlie thinks he&rsquo;s coming to &ldquo;PeopleMode&rdquo; when I bring him to you.<br><br>

			And what wonderful photographs you have of you staff and DogMode&rsquo;s special friends on you new wall! 
        	They are really great; I love the one of Susan, Margie and Lilah.<br><br>

			Sincerely,<br><br>

			To the Staff of DogMode:	 						10/13/2009<br><br>

			I so much appreciate your concern over the loss of my Dog, Gus-Gus. 
        	He was always excited to go to DogMode. 
        	Your staff has always taken good care of him. 
        	It was a great comfort to know that I could always count on DogMode to care for him during times when I was out of town.<br><br>

			I miss him a lot already, maybe I&rsquo;ll take L.J. up on his offer some time to come see potential adoptions, of course just now it&rsquo;s the furthest thing from my mind. I can only think about Gus-Gus.<br><br>

			Many thanks for the beautiful flowers, from myself and Gus-Gus.<br><br>

I just wanted to say that I have had my Bassett in dog mode about five times now. 
            The last few times he has been in, they remember him right away. 
        	I think it&rsquo;s so sweet that they take the time to remember people and their dogs. 
        	Everyone is so polite when I come in and there have never been any problems. 
        	My dog has been much better behaved since he has been going, and I think it&rsquo;s great that you offer this kind of service and we appreciate the care you all give the animals.<br>
