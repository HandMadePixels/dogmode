<META name="Description" content="Since 1999, DogMode has been pioneering non-traditional daycare and boarding. DogMode was built on the premise that “a tired dog is a good dog”. Our facility was designed to offer you a modern alternative to the traditional “kennel” style boarding facilities. All of our guests at DogMode enjoy the freedom of being off-leash in a supervised environment that provides enough space for some serious play. Dogs are allowed to run, bark and play till their hearts content without the fear of disturbing a non-dog loving neighbor or breaking one of our valley’s leash law regulations.">

        <span class="subtitle">Lice in Utah/Upper Respiratory Infection</span><br>
        <br>
        <span class="smalltitle">07-27-2009 UPDATE:</span><br>
        <br>
It has been two weeks since we posted news regarding these two issues. We still have had NO new reports of any canines with lice, 
    and just one more canine reported for a possible upper respiratory infection. This single canine already completed a round of antibiotics 
    just to be safe. The guardian just let us know about the infection after reading our update at the front desk regarding this situation. 
    However, we still recommend that you speak with your vet about preemptive measures to prevent lice. 
    Also, if your dog is showing any signs or symptoms of a cough or upper respiratory issues, please keep your dog home from DogMode until you consult your vet.<br>
    <br>
Thank you for being responsible pet owners and being aware of these concerns within our canine community and state. L J<br>

<br>
It has been one week since we posted news regarding these two issues. We have had NO new reports of any canines with lice and only one more canine reported for an upper respiratory infection early last week. 
    However, we still recommend that you speak with your vet about preemptive measures to prevent lice. 
    Also, if your dog is showing any signs or symptoms of a cough or upper respiratory issues that you keep your dog home from DogMode until you consult your vet.<br>
    <br>
Thanks again for being responsible pet owners and being aware of these concerns within our canine community and state. L J <br>

<span class="smalltitle">07-13-2009 NOTICE:</span><br>
<br>
In the last two weeks, two dogs' Guardians informed us that their dogs had come into contact with lice after short boarding stays. 
    Their vets also confirmed that the canines had lice.<br>
    <br>
It is usually rare for lice and fleas to breed in this state because of how dry it is in the summer and cold in the winter. However, lice seems to be going around the canine community and state of Utah.<br>
<br>
DogMode is currently collaborating with Dr. Whitty from Salt Lake Veterinary Services to put in place required treatment for lice. 
    While we come up with a cost effective and efficient system for this treatment we highly recommend you touch base with your vet. Inquire about preemptive measures to combat this issue in a responsible manner.<br>
    <br>
Canine lice is slow-moving and is not communicable to humans or felines.<br>
<br>
Also, fewer than twelve canines have come down with an upper respiratory infection similar to kennel cough. 
    If your canine is showing signs or symptoms of a cough or congestion we highly recommend you take your dog to your vet for an exam. 
    If any dogs are showing these symptoms or confirmed for an infection they must not be brought into DogMode again until they finish a round of antibiotics.<br>
    <br>
Again, neither of these concerns is isolated to DogMode. 
    Lice and upper respiratory symptoms have been seen by vets in the Utah area in dogs that have not been under our care. <br>
    <br>
Please let L J know if you have any questions, concerns or feedback. 
    Thank You for your help and understanding as responsible pet owners with these concerns.<br><br><br></td>
